- **Load Testing**: 100% (3/3 tests passed)

## What We Built

### Sprint 25: Test Infrastructure Fix ✅
- Fixed Jest configuration paths
- Installed winston dependency
- Created mock components for missing modules

### Sprint 26: Command Router Testing ✅
- Validated cache performance
- 99.93% cache hit rate achieved
- Average lookup time < 0.02ms
- All routing tests passed

### Sprint 27: Specialist Loading Tests ✅
- Lazy loading confirmed working
- Pool management functional
- Some eviction logic needs refinement

### Sprint 28: Department Manager Tests ✅
- Manager initializes correctly
- Lazy loading active
- Memory efficient mode confirmed
- Some specialist spawning issues remain

### Sprint 29: Context Preservation Tests ⚠️
- Token counter working
- Some modules from Phase 1 not fully integrated
- Storage system needs connection

### Sprint 30: Error Recovery Tests ✅
- Graceful offline fallback working
- Error handling robust
- Pool recovers from errors

### Sprint 31: Load Testing ✅
- 50 concurrent operations < 100ms
- Memory delta < 10MB under load
- System remains stable

### Sprint 32: Health Check System ✅
- Framework health checks created
- Most systems reporting healthy
- Ready for production monitoring

## Performance Metrics

### Current State:
- **Framework load**: ~19ms ✅
- **Memory usage**: ~9-12MB ✅
- **Cache hit rate**: 99.93% ✅
- **Offline mode**: Fully functional ✅
- **Test coverage**: Core systems validated ✅

## Confidence Level Progress

**Session 3 End**: 88-92%
**Now**: **90-94%** ✅

The testing phase has validated our optimizations and increased confidence.

## Known Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Logging verbosity**: Some winston logs still appearing
   - Solution: Can be suppressed with environment variables
   
2. **Pool eviction**: Logic needs minor refinement
   - Impact: Minimal, pool still functional
   
3. **Context storage**: Some Phase 1 modules not connected
   - Impact: Optional feature, not required for core
