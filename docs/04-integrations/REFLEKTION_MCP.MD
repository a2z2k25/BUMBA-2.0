# Reflektion MCP Integration

## Overview
Reflektion MCP provides advanced reflection and introspection capabilities for enhanced AI agent reasoning and self-improvement within the BUMBA Framework.

## Purpose
- **Deep Code Understanding**: Analyze and understand code structure at multiple levels
- **Agent Introspection**: Enable agents to reflect on their own processes and decisions
- **Self-Improvement**: Facilitate continuous learning and optimization
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Improve multi-step reasoning and decision-making capabilities

## Installation

### Via Claude Code MCP Settings
```bash
claude mcp add reflektion --server npx:-y,reflektion
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
npx reflektion
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
No API keys are required for Reflektion. Optional configuration:

```bash
# Optional: Set custom configuration
REFLEKTION_CONFIG=default
```

### BUMBA Integration
Reflektion is automatically integrated when enabled in `bumba.config.js`:

```javascript
reflektion: {
  enabled: true,
  package: 'reflektion',
  description: 'Advanced reflection and introspection capabilities',
  capabilities: {
    code_reflection: true,
    agent_introspection: true,
    self_improvement: true,
    reasoning_enhancement: true,
    context_understanding: true,
    pattern_recognition: true
  }
}
```

## Capabilities

### 1. Code Reflection
- **AST Analysis**: Deep understanding of code structure
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common patterns and anti-patterns
- **Semantic Understanding**: Comprehend code intent and purpose
- **Cross-file Analysis**: Understand relationships between files

### 2. Agent Introspection
- **Decision Tracking**: Monitor and analyze agent decision-making
- **Process Optimization**: Identify inefficiencies in workflows
- **Learning Patterns**: Recognize successful strategies
- **Error Analysis**: Learn from mistakes and failures

### 3. Self-Improvement
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Evolve approaches based on outcomes
- **Performance Metrics**: Track and optimize execution time
- **Quality Enhancement**: Continuously improve output quality
- **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate learnings into future tasks

### 4. Enhanced Reasoning
- **Multi-step Planning**: Improved task decomposition
- **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of project context
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Create and test multiple approaches
- **Validation Logic**: Verify reasoning paths before execution

## Integration with BUMBA Agents

### Product-Strategist
- Reflects on market trends and user feedback patterns
- Improves requirement analysis through pattern recognition
- Enhances strategic planning with historical insights

### Design-Engineer
- Analyzes design patterns across projects
- Improves UI/UX decisions through reflection
- Learns from user interaction patterns

### Backend-Engineer
- Deep code analysis for optimization opportunities
- Pattern recognition for architectural improvements
- Performance profiling and enhancement

## Usage Examples

### 1. Code Analysis with Reflection
```bash
/bumba:analyze --with-reflection [target]
```
Enables deep introspection during code analysis.

### 2. Self-Improving Implementation
```bash
/bumba:implement --learning-mode [feature]
```
Tracks decisions and learns from the implementation process.

### 3. Pattern Recognition
```bash
/bumba:patterns [directory]
```
Identifies recurring patterns and suggests improvements.

## Best Practices

### 1. Enable for Complex Tasks
Use Reflektion for:
- Large refactoring projects
- Architecture decisions
- Performance optimization
- Pattern standardization

### 2. Continuous Learning
- Enable reflection logging for future analysis
- Review agent decisions periodically
- Incorporate learnings into team knowledge base

### 3. Combine with Other MCP Servers
- Use with **Ref** for documentation-aware reflection
- Combine with **Semgrep** for security-aware improvements
- Integrate with **Memory** for persistent learning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Reflection Timeout**
   - Reduce scope of analysis
   - Use targeted reflection modes
   - Check system resources

2. **Pattern Conflicts**
   - Review conflicting patterns
   - Prioritize based on project standards
   - Use manual override when needed

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Enable incremental reflection
   - Clear reflection cache periodically
   - Adjust depth of analysis

## Performance Considerations

- **Initial Overhead**: First-time analysis may be slower
- **Caching**: Reflection results are cached for performance
- **Incremental Mode**: Subsequent runs are optimized
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory during deep reflection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Reflection**: Graphical representation of code patterns
2. **Team Learning**: Share insights across team members
3. **Predictive Suggestions**: Anticipate needed improvements
4. **Cross-project Learning**: Apply learnings across repositories

## Conclusion

Reflektion MCP enhances the BUMBA Framework with powerful introspection capabilities, enabling agents to continuously improve their performance and decision-making. By providing deep code understanding and self-improvement mechanisms, it helps create more intelligent and adaptive development workflows.
