# Notion Orchestration System Requirements
## BUMBA Framework - Intelligent Project Management

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Product-Strategist Manager as Supreme Orchestrator
- **Primary Owner**: Product-Strategist Manager owns all Notion project workspaces
- **Continuous Updates**: Hook-driven mandatory updates at every milestone
- **Quality Control**: Reviews and validates all agent contributions
- **Executive Mode**: Can elevate to executive status for full team oversight

#### 2. Dependency Management System
- **DAG Creation**: Build directed acyclic graphs for task dependencies
- **Enforcement**: Prevent tasks from starting before dependencies complete
- **Visualization**: Show dependency chains in Notion
- **Critical Path**: Identify and optimize the longest dependency chain

#### 3. Task Allocation Intelligence
- **Skill Matching**: Assign tasks based on agent expertise
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across available agents
- **Availability Tracking**: Monitor agent capacity in real-time
- **Automatic Reallocation**: Reassign tasks on agent failure

#### 4. Timeline Optimization
- **Parallel Execution**: Maximize concurrent work where dependencies allow
- **Bottleneck Prevention**: Identify and resolve resource constraints
- **Time Estimation**: Accurate sprint duration predictions
- **Schedule Adherence**: Track and enforce timeline compliance

#### 5. Knowledge Sharing Hub
- **Central Repository**: All research, findings, and artifacts in Notion
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain project context across sprints
- **Agent Communication**: Enable agents to share discoveries
- **Output Chaining**: Pass sprint outputs to dependent tasks

#### 6. Real-Time Collaboration
- **Live Updates**: Notion board reflects current state instantly
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of task completion
- **Blocker Alerts**: Immediate notification of blocked tasks
- **Team Visibility**: All agents see project state

### Technical Requirements

#### Notion MCP Integration
- **Database Operations**: Create, read, update, delete Notion databases
- **Page Management**: Create and update project pages
- **Block Manipulation**: Add content blocks programmatically
- **Relations**: Link tasks, agents, and dependencies
- **Views**: Create Kanban, Gantt, and timeline views

#### Hook System Integration
```javascript
Required Hooks:
- task:created
- task:claimed  
- task:started
- task:completed
- task:blocked
- milestone:reached
- sprint:completed
- dependency:resolved
- agent:available
- project:updated
```

#### Agent Capabilities
- **Task Discovery**: Agents query Notion for available tasks
- **Task Claiming**: Atomic operation to prevent conflicts
- **Output Posting**: Share findings in knowledge base
- **Status Updates**: Report progress on assigned tasks
- **Dependency Checking**: Verify prerequisites before starting

### Functional Requirements

#### Epic Decomposition
1. Receive high-level request from human
2. Analyze and understand problem space
3. Create comprehensive solution plan
4. Break into 10-minute sprints
5. Map dependencies between sprints
6. Post complete plan to Notion

#### Sprint Execution Flow
1. Identify ready sprints (dependencies met)
2. Match sprints to available agents
3. Agents claim tasks atomically
4. Execute sprint work
5. Post outputs to Notion
6. Mark sprint complete
7. Trigger dependent sprint evaluation
8. Update project progress

#### Dependency Enforcement
- No sprint starts before dependencies complete
- Visual indication of blocked tasks
- Automatic unblocking when dependencies resolve
- Critical path highlighting
- Dependency violation prevention

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Sprint allocation: <1 second
- Notion sync: <2 seconds
- Dependency evaluation: <500ms
- Full project update: <5 seconds

#### Reliability
- Atomic task claiming (no double allocation)
- Graceful failure recovery
- Persistent state in Notion
- Automatic retry on API failures

#### Scalability
- Support 10+ parallel agents
- Handle 100+ tasks per project
- Manage complex dependency graphs
- Maintain performance at scale

### Success Metrics

1. **Zero Conflicts**: No task double-allocation
2. **100% Dependency Compliance**: No out-of-order execution
3. **Maximum Parallelization**: All independent tasks run concurrently
4. **Complete Visibility**: Full project state in Notion
5. **Seamless Handoffs**: Outputs flow between sprints automatically
6. **Optimal Timeline**: Critical path execution maintained
7. **Quality Assurance**: All outputs reviewed by Product-Strategist

### User Stories

#### As a Human Operator
- I want to see project progress in real-time
- I want to understand task dependencies visually
- I want to know which agent is working on what
- I want to be alerted to blockers immediately

#### As Product-Strategist Manager
- I need to orchestrate complex projects
- I need to enforce dependency chains
- I need to optimize resource allocation
- I need to maintain project quality

#### As a Specialist Agent
- I need to find tasks matching my skills
- I need to claim tasks without conflicts
- I need to access prerequisite outputs
- I need to share my findings

### Integration Points

1. **Sprint Decomposition System**: Already built, needs integration
2. **Git Orchestration System**: Prevent code conflicts
3. **Hook System**: Trigger updates and notifications
4. **Department Managers**: Coordinate through Product-Strategist
5. **Specialist Agents**: Task execution layer

### Constraints

- Must use existing Notion MCP server
- Must integrate with current sprint system
- Cannot break existing Git orchestration
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Product-Strategist must remain primary orchestrator

### Risk Mitigation

- **API Rate Limits**: Batch Notion operations
- **Network Failures**: Local queue with retry
- **Circular Dependencies**: Detection and prevention
- **Agent Failures**: Automatic task reallocation
- **Data Loss**: Continuous Notion backup
