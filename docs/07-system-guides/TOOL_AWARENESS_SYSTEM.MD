# BUMBA Tool Awareness System

## Overview

The Tool Awareness System solves a critical challenge in AI agent frameworks: agents often "forget" about available tools and MCP servers, leading to inefficient workflows and missed opportunities. This system ensures persistent contextual awareness of all available tools across the entire BUMBA agent team.

## Problem Statement

AI agents frequently:
- Forget about available tools in longer conversations
- Don't utilize optimal tools for specific tasks
- Lack awareness of newly added capabilities
- Miss opportunities to combine tools effectively

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Tool Registry System (`tool-awareness-system.js`)
- **Centralized Registry**: Maintains a comprehensive catalog of all tools and MCP servers
- **Contextual Suggestions**: Analyzes tasks to recommend relevant tools
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitors tool usage patterns for optimization
- **Periodic Reminders**: Sends awareness reminders during active sessions

### 2. Context Injection System (`tool-context-injector.js`)
- **Automatic Enhancement**: Injects tool awareness into agent prompts
- **Strategy-Based**: Different injection strategies for different task types
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies task patterns and suggests appropriate tools
- **Non-Intrusive**: Enhances without overwhelming the original prompt

### 3. Memory Bridge (`tool-memory-bridge.js`)
- **Persistent Learning**: Stores successful tool combinations in Memory MCP
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies frequently successful tool patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Shares learnings across all agents
- **Continuous Improvement**: Updates recommendations based on outcomes

### 4. Specialist Integration
- **Enhanced Base Class**: All specialists inherit tool awareness capabilities
- **Department-Specific**: Tools relevant to each department are prioritized
- **Automatic Reminders**: Specialists remind themselves about relevant tools
- **Context-Aware**: Tool suggestions adapt to current task context

## Key Features

### Contextual Tool Suggestions
```javascript
// Automatically suggests tools based on task keywords
"Find all implementations of UserService" 
→ Suggests: Serena (semantic search), Search tools

"Create a new React component"
→ Suggests: File operations, Context7 (React docs), Memory (store decisions)
```

### Persistent Knowledge
- Successful tool combinations are remembered
- Patterns are shared across the agent team
- Learning improves over time

### Department-Specific Awareness
- **Technical Specialists**: Serena, Context7, GitHub, Search tools
- **Design Specialists**: Figma DevMode, Magic UI, Context7
- **Strategic Specialists**: Memory, Notion, GitHub, Airtable

### Automatic Context Enhancement
Prompts are automatically enhanced with relevant tool reminders without disrupting the flow.

## Implementation Details

### Tool Registration
```javascript
// Built-in tools are automatically registered
registerTool('bumba-command', {
  name: 'BUMBA Commands',
  description: 'Core BUMBA framework commands',
  category: 'core',
  examples: [...],
  useCases: [...]
});

// MCP servers are discovered and registered
registerMCPServer('serena', {
  capabilities: ['semantic-search', 'code-navigation'],
  description: 'Semantic code analysis and editing',
  useCases: [...]
});
```

### Context Injection Strategies
1. **Task-based**: Detects keywords like "implement", "create", "fix"
2. **Search-based**: Enhances search operations with tool options
3. **File-based**: Reminds about file operation best practices
4. **Memory-critical**: Prompts to store important decisions

### Usage Tracking
- Tracks which tools are used for which tasks
- Identifies underutilized tools
- Generates reminders for forgotten capabilities

### Memory Integration
- Stores successful tool usage patterns
- Learns from team-wide experiences
- Builds institutional knowledge over time

## Benefits

1. **Increased Efficiency**: Agents use optimal tools for each task
2. **Better Outcomes**: Right tool selection improves result quality
3. **Knowledge Retention**: Team learns and improves collectively
4. **Reduced Friction**: Automatic suggestions reduce cognitive load
5. **Continuous Improvement**: System gets smarter over time

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Tool Suggestion
```
User: "Help me refactor the authentication system"

System automatically suggests:
- Serena: For semantic code navigation and renaming
- Memory: To document refactoring decisions
- GitHub: To track changes and create PR
```

### Pattern Learning
```
After multiple successful uses:
"Refactoring tasks" → [Serena + Memory + Tests]
This pattern is remembered and suggested automatically
```

### Department Awareness
```
Design Engineer working on UI:
- Prioritizes Figma DevMode and Magic UI
- Still has access to all tools
- Receives design-specific tips
```

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Features
```javascript
// In specialist configuration
toolAwareness: {
  remindersEnabled: true,
  reminderInterval: 1800000, // 30 minutes
  contextInjection: true,
  memoryIntegration: true
}
```

### Custom Tool Registration
```javascript
toolAwarenessSystem.registerTool('custom-tool', {
  name: 'My Custom Tool',
  description: 'Does amazing things',
  category: 'custom',
  useCases: ['specific use case']
});
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **ML-Based Suggestions**: Use machine learning to improve tool recommendations
2. **Tool Combination Optimizer**: Suggest optimal tool combinations
3. **Performance Analytics**: Track tool effectiveness metrics
4. **Visual Tool Browser**: Interactive tool discovery interface
5. **Tool Prerequisite Checking**: Ensure required tools are available

## Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Being Suggested
1. Check if tool is properly registered
2. Verify task keywords match suggestion triggers
3. Ensure tool awareness system is initialized

### Memory Integration Issues
1. Verify Memory MCP is installed and running
2. Check memory namespace configuration
3. Review memory search queries

### Overwhelming Suggestions
1. Adjust context injection strategies
2. Limit number of suggestions per task
3. Configure department-specific priorities

## Best Practices

1. **Let the System Learn**: Allow it to track usage patterns
2. **Store Important Decisions**: Use Memory MCP for critical choices
3. **Trust Suggestions**: The system improves with usage
4. **Provide Feedback**: Failed suggestions help improve the system
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep tool registry current with new capabilities

## Integration with BUMBA Ecosystem

The Tool Awareness System integrates seamlessly with:
- **Specialist System**: Enhanced base class with built-in awareness
- **Hook System**: Prompt enhancement through hooks
- **Memory System**: Persistent knowledge storage
- **MCP Resilience**: Fallback handling for unavailable tools
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track tool usage efficiency

This comprehensive system ensures that every agent in the BUMBA framework maintains continuous awareness of available tools, leading to more efficient and effective task completion.
