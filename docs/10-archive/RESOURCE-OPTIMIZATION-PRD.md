## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines critical improvements to the BUMBA CLI's resource management and routing systems. Based on architectural analysis, we've identified four key areas requiring enhancement to achieve optimal performance and resource utilization.

---

## 1. IMPLEMENTING 80/20 POOLING STRATEGY

### Problem Statement
Currently, BUMBA spawns specialists on-demand without maintaining a warm pool, leading to:
- Cold start latency (100-200ms per specialist)
- Resource spikes during high demand
- Inefficient memory utilization
- No predictive pre-warming

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR1.1:** System SHALL maintain 80% of specialists in active state
- **FR1.2:** System SHALL keep 20% of specialists in warm idle state
- **FR1.3:** System SHALL auto-rebalance pools every 30 seconds
- **FR1.4:** System SHALL promote idle specialists to active in <10ms
- **FR1.5:** System SHALL demote inactive specialists after 60s idle time
- **FR1.6:** System SHALL pre-warm frequently used specialist combinations

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1.1:** Pool transitions must not exceed 10ms latency
- **NFR1.2:** Memory overhead for idle pool must stay under 50MB
- **NFR1.3:** System must maintain pool ratio within ±5% tolerance
- **NFR1.4:** Pool rebalancing must not block active operations

#### Technical Specifications
```javascript
class SpecialistPoolManager {
  config: {
    poolRatio: { active: 0.8, idle: 0.2 },
    rebalanceInterval: 30000,
    idleTimeout: 60000,
    warmupTime: 5000,
    maxPoolSize: 100,
    minPoolSize: 10
  }
}
```

### Success Metrics
- Specialist activation time: <10ms (from 100-200ms)
- Memory utilization: 20% reduction
- Cold starts: <5% of requests
- Pool efficiency: >85% hit rate

### User Stories
1. **As a developer**, I want specialists to spawn instantly so my workflow isn't interrupted
2. **As a system admin**, I want predictable resource usage so I can capacity plan
3. **As the framework**, I want to pre-warm specialists based on usage patterns

---

## 2. ADDING TTL-BASED ROUTING DECISIONS

### Problem Statement
BUMBA currently routes tasks without considering time constraints, causing:
- Inappropriate specialist selection for urgent tasks
- No deadline-aware optimization
- Missing SLA compliance mechanisms
- Inefficient resource allocation for time-sensitive operations

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR2.1:** System SHALL calculate TTL for every incoming task
- **FR2.2:** System SHALL route based on TTL thresholds:
  - <5s: Lite mode (3 agents max)
  - 5-30s: Simple mode (1 specialist)
  - 30-180s: Moderate mode (2-3 specialists)
  - >180s: Complex mode (5+ specialists)
- **FR2.3:** System SHALL adjust complexity scoring based on deadline
- **FR2.4:** System SHALL escalate priority for near-deadline tasks
- **FR2.5:** System SHALL provide TTL warnings at 75%, 90%, 95%

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR2.1:** TTL calculation must complete in <1ms
- **NFR2.2:** Routing decisions must be deterministic
- **NFR2.3:** System must maintain 99% SLA compliance
- **NFR2.4:** TTL tracking accuracy must be within 100ms

#### Technical Specifications
```javascript
interface TTLRouter {
  calculateTTL(task: Task): number;
  getRoutingMode(ttl: number): RoutingMode;
  adjustComplexity(base: number, ttl: number): number;
  monitorDeadline(taskId: string): DeadlineMonitor;
}
```

### Success Metrics
- SLA compliance: >99%
- Deadline misses: <1%
- Average response time: 30% improvement
- Resource efficiency: 25% improvement

### User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want urgent tasks completed quickly even if less thorough
2. **As a product owner**, I want to meet SLAs consistently
3. **As the system**, I want to optimize resource allocation based on time constraints

## 3. CREATING A PROPER SELECTION MATRIX

### Problem Statement
Current routing uses ad-hoc complexity calculations without a structured decision matrix:
- Inconsistent specialist selection
- No clear mapping between task characteristics and resources
- Missing capability matching
- Unpredictable performance characteristics

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR3.1:** System SHALL implement a 4x4 selection matrix:
  - Rows: Complexity levels (Simple/Moderate/Complex/Executive)
  - Columns: Task types (Code/API/Design/Strategy)
- **FR3.2:** Each matrix cell SHALL define:
  - Specialist count (1-10)
  - Specialist types (specific roles)
  - TTL range (seconds)
  - Memory allocation (MB)
- **FR3.3:** System SHALL score tasks across multiple dimensions
- **FR3.4:** System SHALL support matrix overrides via configuration
- **FR3.5:** System SHALL log matrix decisions for analysis

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR3.1:** Matrix lookup must be O(1) complexity
- **NFR3.2:** Matrix must be configurable without code changes
- **NFR3.3:** Matrix decisions must be explainable
- **NFR3.4:** Matrix must support A/B testing

#### Technical Specifications
```javascript
const SELECTION_MATRIX = {
  simple: {
    code: { specialists: ['generalist'], count: 1, ttl: 30, memory: 50 },
    api: { specialists: ['api-specialist'], count: 1, ttl: 30, memory: 75 },
    design: { specialists: ['ui-designer'], count: 1, ttl: 45, memory: 100 },
    strategy: { specialists: ['analyst'], count: 1, ttl: 60, memory: 50 }
  },
  moderate: { /* ... */ },
  complex: { /* ... */ },
  executive: { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Success Metrics
- Routing consistency: >95%
- Specialist utilization: >80%
- Task success rate: >90%
- Performance predictability: ±10% variance

### User Stories
1. **As a developer**, I want consistent specialist assignment for similar tasks
2. **As a manager**, I want predictable performance characteristics
3. **As the framework**, I want deterministic resource allocation

## 4. ENHANCED LIFECYCLE STATE MANAGEMENT

### Problem Statement
Current lifecycle is binary (active/dissolved) missing important intermediate states:
- No warming/cooling periods
- Missing execution state tracking
- No graceful degradation
- Insufficient state transition logging

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR4.1:** System SHALL implement 7-state lifecycle:
  1. INITIALIZING: Being created
  2. IDLE: Ready but unused
  3. WARMING: Preparing for task
  4. ACTIVE: Ready for work
  5. EXECUTING: Processing task
  6. COOLING: Post-task cleanup
  7. TERMINATED: Dissolved
- **FR4.2:** System SHALL enforce valid state transitions
- **FR4.3:** System SHALL emit events for each transition
- **FR4.4:** System SHALL persist state for recovery
- **FR4.5:** System SHALL provide state duration metrics

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR4.1:** State transitions must be atomic
- **NFR4.2:** State machine must be thread-safe
- **NFR4.3:** State history must be retained for 24 hours
- **NFR4.4:** Recovery from crash must restore state

#### Technical Specifications
```javascript
class SpecialistStateMachine {
  states: enum {
    INITIALIZING = 'initializing',
    IDLE = 'idle',
    WARMING = 'warming',
    ACTIVE = 'active',
    EXECUTING = 'executing',
    COOLING = 'cooling',
    TERMINATED = 'terminated'
  }
  
  transitions: {
    initializing: ['idle', 'terminated'],
    idle: ['warming', 'terminated'],
    warming: ['active', 'idle', 'terminated'],
    active: ['executing', 'cooling', 'idle'],
    executing: ['cooling', 'active'],
    cooling: ['idle', 'terminated'],
    terminated: []
  }
}
```

### Success Metrics
- State transition success: >99.9%
- Invalid transitions: <0.1%
- State recovery success: >95%
- Audit compliance: 100%

### User Stories
1. **As a developer**, I want to see exactly what state each specialist is in
2. **As an auditor**, I want complete state transition history
3. **As the system**, I want to recover gracefully from failures
