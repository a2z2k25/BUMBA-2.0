## Execution Strategy

### Approach Order:
1. **Specialists First** - Biggest gap, most impact
2. **Monitoring Second** - Critical for operations
3. **Consciousness Third** - Important for framework identity
4. **Tests Fourth** - Needed for verification
5. **Integration Last** - Ties everything together

### Key Principles:
- **Real Implementation** - No mocks, no placeholders
- **Test Each Sprint** - Verify functionality immediately
- **Document Changes** - Update as we go
- **Atomic Commits** - Each sprint is a complete unit

### Success Criteria:
- All 30+ specialists have working implementations
- Monitoring systems instantiate and collect real metrics
- Consciousness validation accessible and functional
- Test suite runs to completion
- 95%+ framework completeness achieved
