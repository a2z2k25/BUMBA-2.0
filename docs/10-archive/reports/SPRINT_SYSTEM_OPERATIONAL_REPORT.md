# Sprint System Operational Report
## BUMBA Framework - 10-Minute Sprint Methodology

**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Status**: 🏁 **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

---

## Executive Summary

The Sprint Decomposition System has been successfully implemented and integrated into the BUMBA Framework. All tests pass, and the system is ready for production use. The implementation prevents context rot by ensuring no AI agent works on a task for more than 10 minutes without creating clear checkpoints.

## 🟢 Sprint Methodology Implementation

### How It Works

1. **Task Reception**: Manager receives a task
2. **Complexity Analysis**: Automatic assessment of task complexity
3. **Sprint Trigger**: Tasks with complexity > 0.3 trigger sprint decomposition
4. **Sprint Planning**: Task broken into 10-minute executable chunks
5. **Execution**: Sprints executed sequentially or in parallel
6. **Tracking**: Real-time progress tracking and reporting

### Sprint Types Supported

| Sprint Type | Duration | Purpose | Deliverables |
|-------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| Analysis | 5 min | Understanding requirements | Requirements, constraints, approach |
| Planning | 8 min | Creating detailed plans | Project plan, sprint breakdown, resources |
| Implementation | 10 min | Writing code/content | Code, tests, documentation |
| Review | 5 min | Quality assurance | Feedback, approval, improvements |
| Testing | 7 min | Validation | Test results, coverage, issues |
| Documentation | 6 min | Knowledge capture | Docs, examples, API reference |
