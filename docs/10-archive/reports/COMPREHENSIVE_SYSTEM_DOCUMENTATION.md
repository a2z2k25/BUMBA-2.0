---

## 🟢 Core Components Analysis

### 1. ParallelAgentSystem - Base Execution Engine

**Purpose**: The foundation of BUMBA's parallel execution capabilities. Enables TRUE concurrent API calls to multiple LLMs.

**Key Features**:
- **Real Parallel Execution**: Uses `Promise.all()` for actual concurrent API calls
- **Multi-Model Support**: Claude (via Anthropic), GPT-4 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google)
- **Default Claude Integration**: Works with Claude Code API by default (no additional keys needed)
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time cost calculation per API call
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with configurable attempts
- **Event-Driven**: Emits events for wave start/complete
- **Agent Specialization**: Predefined system prompts for different agent types

**Architecture**:
```javascript
// Actual parallel execution code
const executionPromises = tasks.map(task => 
  this.executeWithRetry({ ...task, executionId })
);
const results = await Promise.all(executionPromises); // TRUE PARALLELISM
```

**Agent Types Supported**:
- Product Strategy Specialists
- Design Engineering Specialists  
- Backend Engineering Specialists
- Security Specialists
- QA Testing Specialists
- Frontend/Database/DevOps Specialists

**Metrics Tracked**:
- Parallel executions count
- Average execution time
- Success rate
- Total cost and tokens
- API calls per session

### 2. SupervisedParallelSystem - Claude Supervision + Knowledge Transfer

**Purpose**: Combines cost-effective models (Gemini/GPT) with Claude's superior quality control.

**Key Features**:
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses FREE Gemini for initial work, Claude for review
- **Quality Assurance**: Claude validates and improves outputs from cheaper models
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Bi-directional learning between sessions
- **Smart Supervision**: Only triggers for critical tasks (security, production, architecture)
- **Multiple Strategies**:
  - Review-and-Merge: Claude improves and merges outputs
  - Branching: Multiple approaches evaluated
  - Real-Time: Live monitoring and intervention

**Supervision Decision Logic**:
```javascript
// Determines if Claude review is needed
if (task.type.includes('security') || 
    task.type.includes('production') ||
    Math.random() < supervisionSampleRate) {
  // Trigger Claude supervision
}
```

**Cost Savings**:
- Gemini: FREE (60 requests/minute)
- Claude supervision: Only for critical paths
- Typical savings: 70-90% vs Claude-only approach

**Knowledge Flow**:
1. Ancillary models generate solutions
2. System extracts patterns and concerns
3. Claude receives knowledge package with context
4. Claude's improvements stored for future tasks
5. Learning accumulates across sessions

---

### 3. HierarchicalManagerSystem - Manager Delegation with Claude Priority

**Purpose**: Ensures domain expertise and proper delegation with Claude managing critical decisions.

**Hierarchy Structure**:
```
Executive Level (Always Claude)
└── Product Strategist Executive (CEO authority)

Manager Level (Claude for domain-specific)
├── Product Strategist Manager
│   └── Business Analyst, Market Researcher (Gemini)
├── Design Engineer Manager
│   └── UI Designer, UX Researcher, Frontend Dev (Gemini)
└── Backend Engineer Manager
    └── Backend Dev, Security Engineer, DevOps (Gemini)
```

**Decision Rules**:
1. **Single Domain** → Domain-specific manager uses Claude
2. **Multiple Domains** → Product Strategist coordinates with Claude
3. **Strategic Decisions** → Executive mode with CEO authority
4. **Worker Tasks** → Cost-effective models (Gemini/GPT)

**Example Flow**:
- User requests: "Design and implement secure authentication"
- System detects: design + backend + security domains
- Product Strategist (Claude) coordinates
- Design Manager (Claude) plans UI/UX
- Backend Manager (Claude) plans architecture
- Workers (Gemini) execute implementation
- Managers (Claude) review quality

---

### 4. KnowledgeTransferSystem - Learning and Persistence

**Purpose**: Enables learning across sessions and models through knowledge persistence.

**Knowledge Types Stored**:
- **Decisions**: Architectural and strategic choices
- **Patterns**: Successful implementation patterns
- **Corrections**: Claude's fixes to ancillary outputs
- **Improvements**: Optimizations and enhancements
- **Failures**: What didn't work (to avoid repetition)
- **Context**: Project-specific information

**Knowledge Lifecycle**:
1. **Extraction**: Patterns, concerns, keywords from outputs
2. **Storage**: Persisted to disk in `.bumba/knowledge/`
3. **Indexing**: By tag, model, timestamp, importance
4. **Retrieval**: Relevant context for similar tasks
5. **Compression**: Old knowledge compressed after 30 days

**Transfer Mechanisms**:
```javascript
// TO Supervisor (ancillary → Claude)
knowledgePackage = {
  previousDecisions: [...],
  relevantPatterns: [...],
  historicalContext: [...],
  concerns: [...]
}

// FROM Supervisor (Claude → system)
learnedKnowledge = {
  improvements: [...],
  corrections: [...],
  decision: "...",
  reasoning: "..."
}
```

## 🟢 Mode Interaction and Orchestration

### Wave-Based Execution
All modes (except LITE) use wave-based orchestration:

```
Wave 1: Analysis (parallel agents gather information)
   ↓
Wave 2: Planning (parallel agents create strategies)
   ↓
Wave 3: Implementation (parallel agents execute)
   ↓
Wave 4: Validation (parallel agents verify)
```

### Mode Switching
Modes can be dynamically switched based on task requirements:

```javascript
// Automatic mode selection based on task
if (task.includes('security')) {
  setMode('paranoid');
} else if (task.urgent) {
  setMode('turbo');
} else if (task.simple) {
  setMode('lite');
}
```

### Cost Optimization by Mode
- **LITE**: Lowest cost (single call)
