  // Core configuration
  maxConcurrentPipelines: 10,
  defaultTimeout: 600000,
  bufferSize: 1000,
  retryAttempts: 3,
  
  // Enhancement features
  enhancedMode: true,
  schedulingEnabled: true,
  orchestrationEnabled: true,
  optimizationEnabled: true,
  analyticsEnabled: true,
  
  // Advanced options
  resourceAware: true,
  timeSlicing: true,
  adaptiveOptimization: true,

  realtimeMonitoring: true
});
```

## Usage Examples

### Schedule Pipeline with Resources
```javascript
const scheduled = await scheduler.schedulePipeline(pipeline, {
  priority: 2,
  resources: { cpu: 50, memory: 2048 },
  dependencies: ['pipeline_123'],
  constraints: { timeWindow: 'business-hours' }
});
```

### Create Orchestrated Workflow
```javascript
const orchestration = await orchestrator.createOrchestration({
  name: 'Data Processing Workflow',
  pattern: 'map-reduce',
  pipelines: [mapper, reducer],
  distributed: true
});
```

### Optimize Pipeline
```javascript
const optimization = await optimizer.optimizePipeline(pipelineId);
// Automatically applies caching, compression, parallelization
```

### Generate Analytics Report
```javascript
const report = await analytics.generateReport({
  pipelines: ['pipeline_1', 'pipeline_2'],
  metrics: ['throughput', 'latency', 'errors'],
  format: 'html'
});
```
