# TTL-Based Routing Implementation Plan

## Objective 2: Time-To-Live Based Intelligent Routing

### Overview
Implement a sophisticated routing system that makes decisions based on Time-To-Live (TTL) requirements, ensuring specialists are assigned based on urgency, complexity, and expected completion time.

### Key Concepts

#### TTL Tiers (from the diagram)
1. **Tier 1: Ultra-Fast (<5s)** - Cached specialists, immediate response
2. **Tier 2: Fast (5-30s)** - Warm pool specialists
3. **Tier 3: Standard (30-180s)** - Cold pool with warming
4. **Tier 4: Extended (>180s)** - Complex tasks, batch processing
