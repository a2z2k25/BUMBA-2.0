## 4. Preservation Verification

### Code Preservation Results

| Metric | Result | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Classes Preserved** | 18/20 (90%) | >85% | 🏁 PASS |
| **Methods Preserved** | 11/12 (91.7%) | >85% | 🏁 PASS |
| **Core Isolation** | INTACT | No imports | 🏁 PASS |
| **Files Modified** | 0 | 0 | 🏁 PASS |

### Missing Elements Analysis
- **MemoryContextBroker**: Never existed in codebase
- **UnifiedCommunicationSystem**: Never existed in codebase
- **initializeFramework()**: Framework uses `initialize()` instead

**Verdict:** All actual existing elements preserved
