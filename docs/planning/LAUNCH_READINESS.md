## 🟡 YELLOW FLAGS (Minor Issues)

### Timer Management ⚠️
- **Issue**: 893 setInterval/setTimeout calls, only 367 cleaned up
- **Impact**: Processes don't exit cleanly
- **Workaround**: Users can Ctrl+C or use process managers
- **Fix Priority**: Medium (annoying but not breaking)

### Error Messages ⚠️
- **Issue**: Some errors are technical ("API key not configured")
- **Impact**: New users might be confused
- **Workaround**: SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md explains everything
- **Fix Priority**: Low (documentation covers it)

### Demo Experience ⚠️
- **Issue**: No quick "wow" demo
- **Impact**: Users don't immediately see the magic
- **Workaround**: test-agent-operability.js shows capabilities
- **Fix Priority**: Medium (would help adoption)

---

## 🔴 RED FLAGS (Needs Attention)

### Memory Patterns ❌
- **Issue**: Not tested for long-running sessions
- **Risk**: Potential memory leaks from caching/pooling
- **Recommendation**: Run 24-hour test before v2.1

### The "110 Specialists" Problem ❌
- **Issue**: Overwhelming and most are untested
- **Risk**: Users try broken specialists, get frustrated
- **Recommendation**: Create "verified specialists" list
