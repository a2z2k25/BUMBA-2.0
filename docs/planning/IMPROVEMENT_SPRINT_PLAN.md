## The Bottom Line

This sprint transforms BUMBA from "interesting but fragile" to "solid and reliable."

**Total Effort**: 5 days (or 3 days with 2 developers)
**Risk**: Low (no architecture changes)
**Impact**: High (fixes real problems)
**Result**: A framework I'd recommend without disclaimers

After this sprint, BUMBA won't just work - it will work reliably, honestly, and transparently.

*Then* we ship it.
