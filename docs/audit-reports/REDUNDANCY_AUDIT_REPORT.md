# Command Router Redundancy Cleanup Report

## Cleanup Completed Successfully ✅

### Files Deleted (8 files)
1. ✅ `/src/core/commands/bumba-command-router.js` - Obsolete V1 router
2. ✅ `/src/core/commands/bumba-command-router-v2.js` - Redundant V2 router  
3. ✅ `/src/core/commands/command-router-with-managers.js` - Duplicate router
4. ✅ `/src/core/commands/test-manager-routing.js` - Test file for deleted router
5. ✅ `/src/core/commands/test-manager-routing-v2.js` - Test file for deleted V2 router
6. ✅ `/src/core/commands/verify-manager-routing.js` - Verification file for deleted router
7. ✅ `/src/core/commands/final-system-test.js` - Test file depending on deleted router
8. ✅ `/src/core/commands/test-model-assignment.js` - Test file depending on deleted V2 router

### Files Kept
1. ✅ `/src/core/command-handler.js` - Main handler (verified working)
2. ✅ `/src/core/command-router-integration.js` - Active routing logic (verified working)

### System Status After Cleanup
- **CommandRouterIntegration**: ✅ Loads successfully
- **Command Handler**: ✅ Initializes with 71 commands
- **Dependencies**: ✅ No broken imports
- **Test Impact**: Removed obsolete test files that depended on deleted routers

### Architecture Simplified
**Before**: 5 router implementations causing confusion
**After**: 1 clear router (`CommandRouterIntegration`) handling all routing

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider renaming `CommandRouterIntegration` to `BumbaCommandRouter` for clarity
2. Update any documentation that references the old routers
3. Add a comment in `command-handler.js` noting that `CommandRouterIntegration` is the official router
