- Preserves state across mode switches

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g bumba-framework
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### In Terminal (Bridge Mode)
```bash
# Analyze your project
bumba analyze

# Prepare a task for Claude
bumba prepare "implement user authentication"
# Output: Task prepared. ID: task_abc123

# Prepare visual implementation
bumba vision screenshot.png
# Output: Vision task prepared. ID: vision_xyz789
```

### In Claude Code (Enhancement Mode)
```
# Auto-activates when you open Claude
🏁 BUMBA Enhancement Mode Activated
3 prepared tasks ready for execution

# Execute prepared task
/bumba:execute task_abc123

# Direct implementation
/bumba:implement "real-time chat system"

# Vision analysis
/bumba:vision screenshot.png
```

## 🌉 Bridge Mode Features

### Task Preparation
Prepare complex implementation tasks with full context:

```bash
bumba prepare "build e-commerce checkout flow"
```

BUMBA will:
- Analyze your project structure
- Detect tech stack and patterns
- Identify relevant files
- Generate handoff instructions

### Context Analysis
Deep project understanding before AI execution:

```bash
bumba analyze
```

Output:
```
📊 Analysis Results:
Project Type: react
Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Patterns: Component-based, API endpoints, Test structure
Health Score: 95/100
```

### Task Management
View and manage prepared tasks:

```bash
bumba list
```

---

## 🚀 Enhancement Mode Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
Leverage specialized agents working in parallel:

```
/bumba:implement "user dashboard with analytics"
```

Agents activated:
- 🟡 ProductStrategist: Requirements analysis
- 🟢 BackendEngineer: API development
- 🔴 DesignEngineer: UI implementation
- 🟠 QualityAssurance: Testing & validation

### Vision Implementation
Build UIs from images:

```
/bumba:vision design-mockup.png
```

BUMBA will:
- Analyze UI components
- Extract color schemes
- Generate responsive layouts
- Create implementation code

### Real-time Execution
Watch as multiple agents collaborate:

```
🟡 Strategy: Analyzing requirements...
🟢 Backend: Creating API endpoints...
🔴 Frontend: Building components...
🟠 QA: Running tests...
✅ Implementation complete!
```

## 👁️ Vision Capabilities

### Image Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze any UI image
const analysis = await bumba.vision.analyze('screenshot.png');
// Returns: components, colors, layout, suggestions
```

### Automatic Implementation
```javascript
// Generate code from image
const result = await bumba.vision.implement('design.png', {
  framework: 'react',
  generateTests: true
});
// Creates: components, styles, tests, layout
```

### Visual Feedback
```javascript
// Compare implementation with original
const feedback = await bumba.vision.compare('original.png', implementation);
// Returns: match score, differences, suggestions
```

---

## 🔄 Hybrid Workflow

### 1. Prepare in Terminal
```bash
# Morning: Prepare tasks offline
bumba prepare "implement payment processing"
bumba prepare "add real-time notifications"
bumba analyze
```

### 2. Execute in Claude
```
# Open Claude Code
/bumba:execute task_payment_123
/bumba:execute task_notifications_456
```

### 3. Seamless Handoff
Tasks prepared in terminal are instantly available in Claude with full context preservation.
