# BUMBA Multi-Agent Demo

## 🚀 Experience BUMBA's Parallel Agent System Without API Keys!

This demo showcases how BUMBA's multi-agent system works with multiple AI specialists collaborating in parallel - all without requiring any API keys or external services.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the default demo
npm run demo

# Or run directly
node demo-agents.js
```

## Demo Features

### 🤖 12 Specialized Agents
The demo simulates 12 different AI agents across 4 departments:
- **Product Department** (🟡): Product Manager, Business Analyst, Requirements Analyst
- **Design Department** (🔴): UI Designer, UX Researcher, Interaction Designer  
- **Backend Department** (🟢): Backend Engineer, Database Architect, API Specialist
- **QA Department** (🟠): Test Engineer, Security Specialist, Performance Analyst

### ⚡ Parallel Execution
Watch as multiple agents work simultaneously:
- Agents perform analysis in parallel
- Tasks that would take 3900ms sequentially complete in ~1200ms
- ~65% efficiency gain through parallelization

### 🤝 Cross-Department Collaboration
See how agents collaborate:
- Product + Design: User flow reviews
- Design + Backend: API contract definitions
- Backend + Backend: Data structure optimization
- QA + QA: Security test planning

### 📊 Real-time Metrics
The demo shows:
- Active agent count
- Task completion times
- Parallel vs sequential performance comparison
- Simulated output generation

## Running Different Scenarios

```bash
# Build a dashboard
node demo-agents.js build dashboard

# Create payment system
node demo-agents.js create payment system

# Design chat interface
node demo-agents.js design chat interface

# Implement authentication
node demo-agents.js implement user authentication
```

## Demo Variations

### 1. Simple Multi-Agent Demo (Default)
```bash
npm run demo
```
Shows agents initializing, working in parallel, collaborating, and integrating results.

### 2. Visual Simulation Demo
```bash
npm run demo:visual
```
Interactive demo with visual spinners and progress indicators (requires `ora` package).

### 3. Real-time Activity Demo
```bash
npm run demo:realtime
```
Terminal UI showing live agent activity (requires `blessed` package for full experience).

## What This Demonstrates

### Without API Keys
- **Agent Initialization**: How departments and specialists are organized
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents working simultaneously  
- **Task Distribution**: Work being assigned to appropriate specialists
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Cross-functional team coordination
- **Performance Gains**: Time savings from parallel execution

### In Production (With APIs)
When connected to actual AI models, the same system would:
- Generate real PRDs with product requirements
- Create actual wireframes and designs
- Write production-ready code
- Develop comprehensive test suites
- Produce complete documentation

## Performance Metrics

The demo shows real performance characteristics:
- **Sequential Time**: Sum of all task durations
- **Parallel Time**: Actual execution time with parallelization
- **Time Saved**: Difference showing efficiency gain
- **Efficiency**: Percentage improvement over sequential execution

## Technical Details

### No External Dependencies
- ✅ No API keys required
- ✅ No internet connection needed
- ✅ No model downloads
- ✅ Pure JavaScript simulation

### What's Being Simulated
- Agent lifecycle (initialization → work → completion)
- Realistic task durations
- Department-based routing
- Specialist selection algorithms
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Output file generation (paths only)

## Understanding the Output

### Phase 1: Initialization
Shows each department spinning up its specialist agents.

### Phase 2: Parallel Analysis
Demonstrates multiple agents analyzing the task simultaneously.

### Phase 3: Collaborative Work
Shows agents working together, including cross-department collaboration.

### Phase 4: Integration
Simulates the final integration of all agent outputs.

### Results Summary
- Department breakdown
- Generated outputs (simulated file paths)
- Performance metrics
- Efficiency calculations

## Customization

Edit `demo-agents.js` to:
- Add more agents
- Change task durations
- Modify collaboration patterns
- Add new departments
- Customize output formats

## Next Steps

After seeing the demo:

1. **Install BUMBA CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g bumba-cli
   ```

2. **Connect AI Models** (optional)
   - Add OpenAI API key for GPT models
   - Configure other model providers

3. **Run Real Commands**
   ```bash
   bumba-slash "/bumba:prd New Feature"
   bumba-slash "/bumba:api User Service"
   ```

## FAQ

**Q: Is this using real AI?**
A: No, this demo simulates the parallel execution system without making actual AI calls.

**Q: How accurate is the simulation?**
A: The timing, parallelization, and collaboration patterns match the real system architecture.

**Q: Can I see real AI generation?**
A: Yes, connect API keys and run actual BUMBA commands to see real content generation.

**Q: Why no API keys for the demo?**
A: To let anyone experience BUMBA's architecture without setup or costs.
