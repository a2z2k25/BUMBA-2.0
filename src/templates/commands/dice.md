# 🟢 BUMBA DICE Mode Command

## Purpose
Roll the dice for random agent combinations to solve problems in unexpected, creative ways!

## Overview

DICE Mode throws traditional agent selection out the window. Instead of carefully choosing specialists, you roll dice to get random combinations that might just lead to breakthrough solutions through chaos and serendipity.

## How It Works

1. **Roll 2d6** → Determines number of agents (2-7)
2. **Random Selection** → Agents chosen by fate
3. **Special Combos** → Lucky patterns trigger bonuses
4. **Chaos Level** → Control how wild it gets

## Usage

```bash
# Activate DICE mode
/bumba:mode dice

# Roll the dice!
/bumba:dice roll

# Don't like your roll? Reroll (limited)
/bumba:dice reroll

# Execute with current roll
/bumba:dice execute "solve world hunger"

# Adjust chaos level (0-1)
/bumba:dice chaos 0.8

# Check your stats
/bumba:dice stats
```

## Chaos Levels

Adjust how random your combinations get:

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0.0 | **Order** | Only compatible agents |
| 0.3 | **Mild** | Mostly sensible with surprises |
| 0.5 | **Wild** | Anything can happen (default) |
| 0.8 | **Chaotic** | Embrace the madness |
| 1.0 | **MAXIMUM** | 🟢️ Hold onto your hat! |

```bash
# Go full chaos
/bumba:dice chaos 1.0
```

## Reroll Limits

You get **3 rerolls** per task (within 5 minutes). Use them wisely!

```bash
/bumba:dice reroll
> 🟢 Dice rerolled!
> Previous: [Product-Strategist, UI-Designer, ...]
> New roll: [Security-Specialist, Market-Researcher, ...]
> Rerolls remaining: 2
```

## Integration with Other Commands

DICE mode affects all BUMBA operations:

```bash
# Regular commands use DICE-rolled agents
/bumba:implement "add user authentication"
> Using DICE roll agents: [rolled combination]

# Team coordination uses random selection
/bumba:team coordinate
> DICE mode active - random specialist selection!
```

## Statistics & Tracking
