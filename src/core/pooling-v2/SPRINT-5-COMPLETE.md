```javascript
class BumbaIntegrationBridge {
  // Automatic fallback triggers
  fallbackThresholds: {
    errorRate: 10%,           // Max 10% errors before fallback
    responseTime: 3x slower,  // Max 3x degradation
    successRate: 80%          // Min 80% success rate
  }
  
  // Real-time monitoring
  monitoring: {
    performance: true,        // Response time tracking
    memory: true,            // Memory efficiency monitoring
